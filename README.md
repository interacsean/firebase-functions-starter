# firebase-functions starter

Starter for Firebase functions with routing essentials setup.

This is architected to be able to separate endpoints by path namespace

```
npm i
npm serve
```

Then visit the demo endpoint provided.

To extend, create more folders under the `functions/` directory, using the createApi helper function.  Add routes as needed.
